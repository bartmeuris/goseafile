# goseafile

This is a simple go library to use the [Seafile](http://seafile.com/) [API](manual.seafile.com/develop/web_api.html).


## Commandline tool

A commandline tool is also available, you can `go get` it like this:

    go get github.com/bartmeuris/goseafile/cmd/seafile-cli

You can check out [the examples](cmd/seafile-cli/examples/) and [documentation](cmd/seafile-cli/).

## TODO

* Implement download feature
* Implement library creation
* Implement directory creation
* Improve scripting: allow to ignore when a command fails
